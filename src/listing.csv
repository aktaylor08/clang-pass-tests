pass1.cpp,publish call inside if statement.
pass2.cpp,Multiple If statements both contain thresholds, publish inside ifs
pass3.cpp,Multiple If statements one contains thresholds, publish inside ifs
pass4.cpp,If statement sets flag that is checked to publish in local function.
pass5.cpp,If statement sets value that is then compared to count to publish value.
pass6.cpp,If statement sets value value is published.
pass7.cpp,Call that checks threshold value in predicate on publish.
pass8.cpp,If statement then calls publish function.
pass9.cpp,If sets flag in seperate function and depends on publish
pass10.cpp,If statement sets a value and then that is published in another thread.
pass11.cpp,If statements sets a value in one function, that value is checked in a different threshold and publish function called.
pass12.cpp,If statements sets a value in one function, that value is checked in a different thread publish happens based on that.
pass13.cpp,Multiple If statements both contain thresholds, publish inside ifs with call
pass14.cpp,Multiple If statements one contains thresholds, publish inside ifs with call
pass15.cpp,Sets value than called to publish in function 
pass16.cpp,If sets flag, Flag checked and publish function called
pass17.cpp,If sets value, value checked and publish function called
pass18.cpp,If statement thresh, calls one function, calls other function publish
pass19.cpp,If statement, call function, check flag, call pub
pass20.cpp,If statement, call function, check value threshold, call pub
pass21.cpp,If statement thresh, calls one function, calls other function,calls one more, publish call
pass22.cpp,If statement thresh, calls one function, calls other function,calls one more threshold, publish call
pass23.cpp,If statement sets value, published in next function call.
pass24.cpp,If statemnt sets flag,  published with call in other function
pass25.cpp,If statement sets value, published from other thread through function call.
